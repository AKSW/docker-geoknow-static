    <dct:abstract>Ontos AG was founded in 2001 with the goal to develop semantic solutions. The privately owned company has key activities in the area of automatic extraction of entities and relations from natural text based on an ontology driven approach and building different web services and solutions. </dct:abstract>
    <dct:description rdf:datatype="&sysont;Markdown">Ontos has a long track record of successfully developing and marketing complex software products with a large share of research work. Examples are the text mining suite OntosMinerâ„¢ (available for many European languages), the web service platform Ontos API or the visualization and analytics suite Ontos News (available at http://news.ontos.com). Headquartered in Switzerland and with development labs &amp; sales offices in Leipzig (Germany), Moscow (Russia) and Belgrade (Serbia), Ontos is one of the few players, which successfully markets semantic technologies in many European countries.

Ontos has launched own solutions on the web as Software-as-a-Service (e.g., http://news.ontos.com) which are used by internet users. Ontos is addressing several industry segments. One is law enforcement where analytical systems are delivered that allow analysing data from structured and unstructured sources based on ontology engineering. Furthermore, Ontos is addressing the market of media and news by supplying tools to automatic annotate web pages using semantic technologies and to create semantic related content that can be published inside the customer web page. The sales activities are in Europe, Russia and Central Asia. Ontos has a patent-pending method for the semantic navigation through web pages based on the automatic semantic annotated information. Ontos is a member of W3C and supports the W3C standards like RDF, OWL and SPARQL.

Ontos is pursuing the vision of the semantic web and related technologies. In addition to semantic technologies, the Ontos team has gained experience in grid computing, data visualisation and designing and implementing the solution inside portals.

    ns8:abbreviation="GeoKnow"
    rdfs:label="GeoKnow">
    <ns8:abstract xml:lang="en">The advent of the Data Web demonstrates how Web technologies can be employed to integrate dispersed, heterogeneous information. Most information - be it the extent of habitats of aquatic species, data warehouses of E-Commerce systems or offerings of the bakery shop next door - has a directly or indirectly associated spatial dimension. Integrating and efficiently using information with such a spatial dimension on the Web poses very particular challenges. 
First, we have to combine and reason about spatial and semantic features that use different vocabularies and representation techniques. Second, the wealth of pre-existing overlapping and complementary information sources in the spatial domain demands information management able to deal with billions of facts in a scalable manner. Third, only by dramatically lowering the entrance barriers extra value can be generated through the involvement of thousands of non-expert end users in authoring, curation and assessment. Within GeoKnow, we will tackle these challenges and spur the transition from islands of isolated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to a Web of interlinked Geographic Knowledge Systems (GKS).
We will validate our approach in two complementary application scenarios: (1) spatial-semantic collaboration in biological scientific communities involving citizen scientists and (2) spatial-semantic travel E-Commerce data management.
GeoKnow will substantially contribute to the evolution of the Web from a medium for information exchange to a medium for (spatial) knowledge integration, e.g. the number of spatial LOD sources will increase from 31to &gt;1,000. GeoKnow will help to realize network effects by increasing quality and coherence of the spatial Data Web, e.g. the data-linkage ratio will increase from 5% to 20%. For enterprises, the GeoKnow Generator will provide a cost-efficient way to integrate a variety of heterogeneous information sources within an Enterprise Data Intranet.</ns8:abstract>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">The goal of task 1.1 is to collect end user requirements from the application areas, and to specify the use cases for GeoKnow. The end users involved in the project (Unister, BROX) will heavily contribute to this task, as well as all other project partners. Further, current user communities (both end users and technology users) of Schnellecke, OpenStreetMap and geodata.gov.gr will be involved. Combined, these platforms provide access to millions of users with diverse (a) expertise (e.g. researchers, students. SMEs, citizens), (b) thematic areas (e.g. natural sciences, transport, statistics), and technology needs (e.g. data consumers, web services integration).
User requirements will be collected through a combination of appropriate instruments: (a) one-to one interviews with prominent users (10-15 users), (b) group meetings with expert users (10-15), (c) invitational online questionnaires for specific non-overlapping thematic areas and high technical expertise (30-60 users), (d) mass online questionnaires (100-200 users). The resulting requirements document for the GeoKnow Generator will be the basis for the subsequent RTD work. All tasks in WP2-WP4 that deal with requirement analysis and specification contribute to this joint activity. InfAI, OpenLink and Ontos will analyse and specify the technical requirements for metadata identification, access to spatial data, selection, construction of knowledge stores, and metadata transfer, that is, in tandem with the development and evaluation of the application-specific demonstrators developed in WP5-WP6, we will also define all necessary technical requirements related to the development under WP2-4.
The requirements will be monitored throughout the lifetime of the project, and in case some additional requirements have to be satisfied, an update of the deliverable D1.1.1 shall be prepared.</dct:description>

    <dct:description rdf:datatype="&sysont;Markdown">This task is devoted to specifying the GeoKnow architecture and the detailed design of the GeoKnow Generator. Scalability, extensibility and flexibility shall be achieved by employing Service Oriented Knowledge Utilities (SOKU) in order to develop next generation GKS. Components of the system will be building blocks developed in individual work packages WP2-4, such as the semantics based geo-spatial information management subsystem (WP2), spatial knowledge fusing and integration methods (WP3), the development of user interfaces for spatial-semantic browsing and authoring (WP4). The developed components will be integrated within this task. While the common technical requirements will be one major input for the system design, other major sources will be the developed use cases and end user requirements as well as interoperability standards.
The system design defines clear interfaces between the individual components. It will be based on existing standards and will provide a modular plugâ€™nâ€™serve structure and shall be able to accommodate REST components and JavaScript user interface widgets. The architecture will be centred around the OWL/RDF-statement paradigm, which enables interactions between components on different conceptual levels, such as triples, classes and instances, ontologies, logical axioms etc.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">During this task individual components developed in WP2-4 will be integrated into a ready to use GKS Generator and associated APIs in order to enable communities of practice to create domain specific GKSes with a minimum of effort. For example, chosing between map providers (e.g. OpenStreetMap, Google Maps) will require no coding, and there will be a widget library, based on the use-cases, with some widgets (e.g. for place searches, ratings, images and facts) being usable across multiple domains. A plug-in system will ensure that new styles and behaviour can be added in case none of the provided components turn out to be applicable.
Thus, this task consists of the following subtasks:
Integration of User Interface Components. The goal of this sub-task is to provide rich GUIs for social-aware GKS applications. 
Integration of GeoKnow Generator and API. The objective of this sub-task is to integrate the GeoKnow components developed in WP2-4 and the Web 2.0 toolkit into a ready to use GKS Generator with underlying service APIs. Within this task we will perform software integration activities together with WP2-4. 
Testing, documentation &amp; tutorials. This sub-task will take the end-user and technical feedbacks resulting from WP5-6 into account to improve the final GeoKnow Generator and provide documentation and tutorials. The documentation of the evaluation should provide both quantitative and qualitative results, through real-life trials of the proposed work. A number of alpha and beta testing results will be documented by this task, which will be conducted after the delivery of each module and provide quantitative results.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">In this task, we will implement social networking interfaces for the authoring components of the GeoKnow Generator. The interfaces will be implemented in two steps, first we integrate a subscription and notification service into the GeoKnow Generator, which will enable users to subscribe to arbitrary information adhering to certain spatial or semantically defined filter criteria. In a second development iteration, we will extend to subscription and notification service for GeoKnow with an API adhering to the Open-social standard. Based on this API, individuals and organisations can be informed on spatial knowledge updates performed by their social neighbourhood. The spatial social networking component is particularly important for the supply chain integration features of WP5.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">In Task 6.4, we will define and conduct a use case scenario based on testing procedures to validate motive-centered queries. We will setup concrete test cases based on example intelligence queries based on the scenario. After execution of these test cases, we evaluate the respective test results by means of quality and quantity measures to check the correctness, completeness and performance of the developed prototype. Additionally, we will conduct usability tests for the developed search concepts described in deliverable D6.3.2. The tests will be integrated in the current web portal environment, in particular ab-in-den-urlaub.de (smaller German use case) and later on travel24.com (larger international use case). The test users are common customers. They should have already indicated (by the origin Google search or after giving textual input) that they would benefit from motive-based search in the field of application limited by the current features of the prototype. Using A/B testing this user segment will get answers to their queries by the current implementation or by the new search process. About 2-3% of the users will be used for this bucket test. The aim of those tests will be to evaluate whether Unister can benefit from motive based search and spatial data integration. The following metrics will be applied: conversion rate, transaction volume, time to PoS, etc. It is assumed that 1.000 customers per test will lead to a profound result.</dct:description>

  <ns2:Task rdf:about="t7-1">
    <dct:description xml:lang="en">The first focus of WP7 is the dissemination of the project results supported by community building and cross-fertilisation activities.
Both the industrial and the academic partners will play active roles in dissemination. For the use case partners, the case studies will form a key part of the dissemination activity. For the academic partners, consultancy to business and contractual research and development will be a significant part of dissemination, besides the normal channels of publications, conference papers, workshop organisation, and educational courses at university sites.
The dissemination programme foresees a multi-channel dissemination approach. First, the project outcomes will be disseminated by use of publicly available channels â€“ such as workshop, conference, magazine, and journal publications. These will be aimed at sharing the results of the project with the scientific community, particularly the European, but also the international scientific community, to encourage their incorporation into the work of other scientists and technologists. Complementing this, there will be a programme of papers and articles in IT, Web Technologies and general business publications, and presentations at geo data, library, IT and business expos and conferences (e.g. LinkedDataPlanet, KM Europe, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), Digital Curation Conference, CeBIT or Systems for telecommunication and IT) particularly targeted at the European Union and associated countries. We envisage that the innovative technology required for building spatial Linked Data applications, and the resulting open GeoKnow Generator, will be of great interest to both SMEs and large businesses alike.
We will put a special focus on demonstration activities in different forms of the possibilities that the newly developed technologies will offer. Target audience will be relevant industry and research actors whose main focus is the development of data and knowledge management systems, new scalable collaboration paradigms and their combination with information retrieval. The participation of globally acting partners (Ontos, OpenLink, BROX) will provide an additional, global dimension to our dissemination programme, in particular with Unister and Openlink as a globally acting E-Commerce and software vendor with offices in the US, and major European countries. Taking advantage of its worldwide unique information infrastructure, with products for enterprise information management, Unister can provide current research and technological solutions developed by the GeoKnow partners an ideal environment for demonstrating their real added value. The GeoKnow consortium will organize two end-user and industry days, one for each of the two case study applications corporate spatial business intelligence and e-science.
The project will set up and maintain an external Web site, which will function as a project dissemination tool, as a training portal and as a server demonstrating some of the project results. The Web site will itself be based on a Semantic Wiki system, so that project participants and interested users can register and be notified when new deliverables or software become available. Within the limitations imposed by appropriate protection of intellectual property, all major scientific results of this project will be made available to the research community, whilst the GeoKnow and components will be published as open source to facilitate take-up. Outcomes will be made available in a non-proprietary format. All open source components published will be extensively documented by means of textual documents and screencasts of professional quality illustrating how to download, install and operate the components in question. Documentation manuals and screencasts will be specifically identified as project deliverables and prominently published on the project&apos;s web site. The project will exploit modern, social-networking dissemination channels such as Weblogs, Newsfeeds (RSS), organize GeoKnow groups in social networks such as LinkedIn, XING, Facebook, Twine. The project will register its web site under the .eu domain for at least 2 years after the natural contractual end of the project and commit to keeping the web site alive for that period of time. It will link to other relevant EC and EC sponsored sites. 
The project will also deliver one or more web-based showcases and grant the EC the right to use the showcase(s) for its own dissemination and awareness activities. After the completion of the project. The Showcase(s) will feature a meaningful subset (software, data, etc.) of the functionality characterising the project demonstrator(s) arrived at, along with relevant copyright notices and contact information, and suitable installation aids and run-time interfaces.
GeoKnow will create a Researcher Early Access Group that will be open to participation to scientists working in related fields. Members of this group will get early access to project infrastructure and will be invited to experiment with GeoKnow components. This will both verify the generality of the plug-in interfaces and encourage take-up of the project results. The scientific communities that will be targeted by our inter-disciplinary community building efforts are very diverse and hitherto largely independent of each other: Geodata Management, Semantic Web and knowledge technologies, machine learning, e-science, and Big Data Management. 
In the first month of the project, the GeoKnow consortium will create a fact sheet suitable for Web publishing. The Fact Sheet will outline the project&apos;s rationale and objectives, specify its technical baseline and intended target groups and application domains, and detail intermediate and final outputs. The facts-sheet will be maintained and updated until the end of the project; this will be documented in the regular dissemination reports. It will be published on the website and related EC sponsored websites controlled by the consortium. Related to the fact sheet, the consortium will issue press releases within one month of the start of the project (prepared by InfAI and Ontos, translation and dissemination by all partners). The press releases will target the local or national press of all partners. The press release will describe the goals of the project in simple, jargon free language and whenever possible highlight the benefits to the region/country and the importance of the local partner being part of a EU consortium. A PDF version of the collection of such press releases will be listed as part of Deliverable D7.1.1. 
If suitable, the consortium may commit to radio and TV appearances. If this is feasible audio/video clips will also be submitted as additional deliverables.
Additionally, we plan to promote cross-fertilisation through inter-disciplinary workshops, organized alongside major conferences in the respective research fields. The GeoKnow partners representing each of these diverse research areas will be responsible to promote the project results within the respective communities. The project partners undertake â€“ when invited â€“ to contribute to and participate in focused concertation actions, themed seminars or special interest groups.</dct:description>

Related to the fact sheet, the consortium will issue press releases within one month of the start of the project (prepared by InfAI and Ontos, translation and dissemination by all partners). The press releases will target the local or national press of all partners. The press release will describe the goals of the project in simple, jargon free language and whenever possible highlight the benefits to the region/country and the importance of the local partner being part of a EU consortium. A PDF version of the collection of such press releases will be listed as part of Deliverable D7.1.1. 
If suitable, the consortium may commit to radio and TV appearances. If this is feasible audio/video clips will also be submitted as additional deliverables.
Additionally, we plan to promote cross-fertilisation through inter-disciplinary workshops, organized alongside major conferences in the respective research fields. The GeoKnow partners representing each of these diverse research areas will be responsible to promote the project results within the respective communities. The project partners undertake â€“ when invited â€“ to contribute to and participate in focused concertation actions, themed seminars or special interest groups.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">The two case studies and the industrial and end-user community partners will drive the exploitation. Their task is to extend the research activities by promoting and supporting the exploitation of the results along with take-up activities related to the perspective applications. The majority of the project results will be made available as open source and the open source exploitation strategy will describe how to leverage the potential of such an open source initiative.
The pillars of GeoKnow exploitation strategy are: tracking important technical and commercial developments in geo data management, semantic web, Web 2.0 as well as geospatial e-science and enterprise applications; analyzing the market sector(s) where the results can be applied and possibly licensed commercially; identifying the results of GeoKnow that are exploitable: particularly the GeoKnow Generator, some of the components and the innovative applications developed within the use cases; and identifying the appropriate distribution channels (including open source community) to exploit the different results of the project.
The major outcome of this work package will be the GeoKnow Exploitation Plan, which will include a list of opportunities that arise from GeoKnow scientific and technical achievements and a detailed analysis of benefit and impact for the GeoKnow consortium as a whole as well as for the results of individual participants. The prestige of both the industrial partners and the use case partners makes the GeoKnow Consortium an international partnership.</dct:description>

Along with these objectives, we will ensure that the project addresses specific end user and industry needs; the GeoKnow technology is flexible and extensible to other domains; the development is in line with the major geo-spatial initiatives by leveraging on, complementing and not reduplicating work already done in this area; social networking approaches, such as for providing feedback on the data quality, correcting errors and adding facts, translations or links,are tightly integrated in the GeoKnow Generator in a generic manner; pre-existing technology developed by the project partners is harmonized. Relevant standards to be adopted shall be monitored under this WP. We will use iterative refinement processes, e.g. by re-assessing the requirements with the help of the end user communities. These will be adapted, if necessary.</dct:description>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The first focus of WP7 is the dissemination of the project results supported by community building and cross-fertilisation activities.
Both the industrial and the academic partners will play active roles in dissemination. For the use case partners, the case studies will form a key part of the dissemination activity. For the academic partners, consultancy to business and contractual research and development will be a significant part of dissemination, besides the normal channels of publications, conference papers, workshop organisation, and educational courses at university sites.
The dissemination programme foresees a multi-channel dissemination approach. First, the project outcomes will be disseminated by use of publicly available channels Ã¢â‚¬â€œ such as workshop, conference, magazine, and journal publications. These will be aimed at sharing the results of the project with the scientific community, particularly the European, but also the international scientific community, to encourage their incorporation into the work of other scientists and technologists. Complementing this, there will be a programme of papers and articles in IT, Web Technologies and general business publications, and presentations at geo data, library, IT and business expos and conferences (e.g. LinkedDataPlanet, KM Europe, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), Digital Curation Conference, CeBIT or Systems for telecommunication and IT) particularly targeted at the European Union and associated countries. We envisage that the innovative technology required for building spatial Linked Data applications, and the resulting open GeoKnow Generator, will be of great interest to both SMEs and large businesses alike.
We will put a special focus on demonstration activities in different forms of the possibilities that the newly developed technologies will offer. Target audience will be relevant industry and research actors whose main focus is the development of data and knowledge management systems, new scalable collaboration paradigms and their combination with information retrieval. The participation of globally acting partners (Ontos, OpenLink, BROX) will provide an additional, global dimension to our dissemination programme, in particular with Unister and Openlink as a globally acting E-Commerce and software vendor with offices in the US, and major European countries. Taking advantage of its worldwide unique information infrastructure, with products for enterprise information management, Unister can provide current research and technological solutions developed by the GeoKnow partners an ideal environment for demonstrating their real added value. The GeoKnow consortium will organize two end-user and industry days, one for each of the two case study applications corporate spatial business intelligence and e-science.
The project will set up and maintain an external Web site, which will function as a project dissemination tool, as a training portal and as a server demonstrating some of the project results. The Web site will itself be based on a Semantic Wiki system, so that project participants and interested users can register and be notified when new deliverables or software become available. Within the limitations imposed by appropriate protection of intellectual property, all major scientific results of this project will be made available to the research community, whilst the GeoKnow and components will be published as open source to facilitate take-up. Outcomes will be made available in a non-proprietary format. All open source components published will be extensively documented by means of textual documents and screencasts of professional quality illustrating how to download, install and operate the components in question. Documentation manuals and screencasts will be specifically identified as project deliverables and prominently published on the project&apos;s web site. The project will exploit modern, social-networking dissemination channels such as Weblogs, Newsfeeds (RSS), organize GeoKnow groups in social networks such as LinkedIn, XING, Facebook, Twine. The project will register its web site under the .eu domain for at least 2 years after the natural contractual end of the project and commit to keeping the web site alive for that period of time. It will link to other relevant EC and EC sponsored sites. 
The project will also deliver one or more web-based showcases and grant the EC the right to use the showcase(s) for its own dissemination and awareness activities. After the completion of the project. The Showcase(s) will feature a meaningful subset (software, data, etc.) of the functionality characterising the project demonstrator(s) arrived at, along with relevant copyright notices and contact information, and suitable installation aids and run-time interfaces.
GeoKnow will create a Researcher Early Access Group that will be open to participation to scientists working in related fields. Members of this group will get early access to project infrastructure and will be invited to experiment with GeoKnow components. This will both verify the generality of the plug-in interfaces and encourage take-up of the project results. The scientific communities that will be targeted by our inter-disciplinary community building efforts are very diverse and hitherto largely independent of each other: Geodata Management, Semantic Web and knowledge technologies, machine learning, e-science, and Big Data Management. 
In the first month of the project, the GeoKnow consortium will create a fact sheet suitable for Web publishing. The Fact Sheet will outline the project&apos;s rationale and objectives, specify its technical baseline and intended target groups and application domains, and detail intermediate and final outputs. The facts-sheet will be maintained and updated until the end of the project; this will be documented in the regular dissemination reports. It will be published on the website and related EC sponsored websites controlled by the consortium. Related to the fact sheet, the consortium will issue press releases within one month of the start of the project (prepared by InfAI and Ontos, translation and dissemination by all partners). The press releases will target the local or national press of all partners. The press release will describe the goals of the project in simple, jargon free language and whenever possible highlight the benefits to the region/country and the importance of the local partner being part of a EU consortium. A PDF version of the collection of such press releases will be listed as part of Deliverable D7.1.1. 
If suitable, the consortium may commit to radio and TV appearances. If this is feasible audio/video clips will also be submitted as additional deliverables.
Additionally, we plan to promote cross-fertilisation through inter-disciplinary workshops, organized alongside major conferences in the respective research fields. The GeoKnow partners representing each of these diverse research areas will be responsible to promote the project results within the respective communities.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">GeoKnow will actively participate in appropriate standards bodies, specifically the W3C and/or DC. Such participation is twofold; on the one hand to ensure that established and emerging standards are taken into account appropriately in the GeoKnow project and, on the other hand, to seek to influence standardisation bodies. Concrete standardisation activities pursued in the context of GeoKnow are listed in section B1.9.4. The consortium represented by its W3C members (OpenLink and Ontos) will together with other actors establish a W3C Spatial Linked Data interest group in order to found a nucleolus for the growing user community of Spatial Data Web technologies.</rdfs:comment>
