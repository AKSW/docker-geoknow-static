ns4:Welcome ns1:content """Geospatial data or geographic information is the data that identifies a geographic location of natural or constructed features and boundaries on the Earth (e.g. oceans, buildings, countries, rivers, etc). Geographical knowledge bases are among the largest in existence and have high importance in a variety of everyday applications. The data can be mapped and often manipulated with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), however the integration of external data sets into these systems is time-consuming and complex. GeoKnow will provide the necessary tools and methods to easily integrate and process data across a wide range of data sources on the web of data.

GeoKnow EU project (2013-2015) has contributed with the GeoKnow Generator which is a stack of tools for bringing geospatial data to the Web of Data. These software tools are available in the Debian repository of the <a href=\"http://stack.linkeddata.org/\" target=\"_blanc\">Linked Data Stack</a>. Together with these tools GeoKnow team has developed the Generator Workbench which is an unified interface for using these tools. This workbench offers several enterprise-ready features such as authentication and data access authorisation. An online demo of the Workbench and GeoKnow Generator tools is available <a href=\"http://generator.geoknow.eu\" target=\"_blanc\">here</a>.
