    <dct:abstract>Brox IT-Solutions (http://www.brox.de) was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Hannover, Germany. Brox core competencies are supporting large enterprises in managing and evolving their IT infrastructure. </dct:abstract>
    <dct:description rdf:datatype="&sysont;Markdown">Brox initiated and is leading the Eclipse.org project SMILA (Unified information access architecture), which is the base platform for the 400M€ German THESEUS Project as well as EU funded projects under FP7. Brox, however, never received any funding from public research projects so far. Brox operates under the commercial open source business model and provides enterprise class SLAs for its SMILA distribution called “eccenca”. The name eccenca references to the term &apos;essence&apos; which is what users of SMILA and eccenca are trying to extract and aggregate from large collections of unstructured data. With over 80% of enterprise information stored in unstructured formats, enterprises of the future will strive to provide &apos;just the essence&apos; of information in order to achieve higher levels of process quality and productivity. Brox is privately held and funded by MBG, KfW and Volksbank. Key customers are Audi, Bombardier, Bosch, Credit Suisse, Daimler Benz, Deutsche Telecom, Dresdner Bank, TUI, Volkswagen and the UK based organization, Institute of Directors.

Brox IT-Solutions is an engineering-driven organization thriving to become a truly global information access and semantic infrastructure provider. Our employees and collaborators are passionate about open source, dedicated to customer success, and committed to creating sustainable benefits for their customers based on the commercial open source software model. BROX has actively participated in large-scale R&amp;D projects, such as the German national Theseus programme. BROX is active member of the Association of Data Quality Management. Brox employs more than 30 consultants and its RTD department comprises 5 employees led by Dr. Michael Hagstöm.</dct:description>

  <ns2:Project rdf:about="GeoKnow"
    ns8:abbreviation="GeoKnow"
    rdfs:label="GeoKnow">
    <ns8:abstract xml:lang="en">The advent of the Data Web demonstrates how Web technologies can be employed to integrate dispersed, heterogeneous information. Most information - be it the extent of habitats of aquatic species, data warehouses of E-Commerce systems or offerings of the bakery shop next door - has a directly or indirectly associated spatial dimension. Integrating and efficiently using information with such a spatial dimension on the Web poses very particular challenges. 
First, we have to combine and reason about spatial and semantic features that use different vocabularies and representation techniques. Second, the wealth of pre-existing overlapping and complementary information sources in the spatial domain demands information management able to deal with billions of facts in a scalable manner. Third, only by dramatically lowering the entrance barriers extra value can be generated through the involvement of thousands of non-expert end users in authoring, curation and assessment. Within GeoKnow, we will tackle these challenges and spur the transition from islands of isolated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to a Web of interlinked Geographic Knowledge Systems (GKS).
We will validate our approach in two complementary application scenarios: (1) spatial-semantic collaboration in biological scientific communities involving citizen scientists and (2) spatial-semantic travel E-Commerce data management.
GeoKnow will substantially contribute to the evolution of the Web from a medium for information exchange to a medium for (spatial) knowledge integration, e.g. the number of spatial LOD sources will increase from 31to &gt;1,000. GeoKnow will help to realize network effects by increasing quality and coherence of the spatial Data Web, e.g. the data-linkage ratio will increase from 5% to 20%. For enterprises, the GeoKnow Generator will provide a cost-efficient way to integrate a variety of heterogeneous information sources within an Enterprise Data Intranet.</ns8:abstract>

    dct:identifier="T1.1">
    <dct:description xml:lang="en">The goal of task 1.1 is to collect end user requirements from the application areas, and to specify the use cases for GeoKnow. The end users involved in the project (Unister, BROX) will heavily contribute to this task, as well as all other project partners. Further, current user communities (both end users and technology users) of Schnellecke, OpenStreetMap and geodata.gov.gr will be involved. Combined, these platforms provide access to millions of users with diverse (a) expertise (e.g. researchers, students. SMEs, citizens), (b) thematic areas (e.g. natural sciences, transport, statistics), and technology needs (e.g. data consumers, web services integration).
User requirements will be collected through a combination of appropriate instruments: (a) one-to one interviews with prominent users (10-15 users), (b) group meetings with expert users (10-15), (c) invitational online questionnaires for specific non-overlapping thematic areas and high technical expertise (30-60 users), (d) mass online questionnaires (100-200 users). The resulting requirements document for the GeoKnow Generator will be the basis for the subsequent RTD work. All tasks in WP2-WP4 that deal with requirement analysis and specification contribute to this joint activity. InfAI, OpenLink and Ontos will analyse and specify the technical requirements for metadata identification, access to spatial data, selection, construction of knowledge stores, and metadata transfer, that is, in tandem with the development and evaluation of the application-specific demonstrators developed in WP5-WP6, we will also define all necessary technical requirements related to the development under WP2-4.
The requirements will be monitored throughout the lifetime of the project, and in case some additional requirements have to be satisfied, an update of the deliverable D1.1.1 shall be prepared.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">During this task individual components developed in WP2-4 will be integrated into a ready to use GKS Generator and associated APIs in order to enable communities of practice to create domain specific GKSes with a minimum of effort. For example, chosing between map providers (e.g. OpenStreetMap, Google Maps) will require no coding, and there will be a widget library, based on the use-cases, with some widgets (e.g. for place searches, ratings, images and facts) being usable across multiple domains. A plug-in system will ensure that new styles and behaviour can be added in case none of the provided components turn out to be applicable.
Thus, this task consists of the following subtasks:
Integration of User Interface Components. The goal of this sub-task is to provide rich GUIs for social-aware GKS applications. 
Integration of GeoKnow Generator and API. The objective of this sub-task is to integrate the GeoKnow components developed in WP2-4 and the Web 2.0 toolkit into a ready to use GKS Generator with underlying service APIs. Within this task we will perform software integration activities together with WP2-4. 
Testing, documentation &amp; tutorials. This sub-task will take the end-user and technical feedbacks resulting from WP5-6 into account to improve the final GeoKnow Generator and provide documentation and tutorials. The documentation of the evaluation should provide both quantitative and qualitative results, through real-life trials of the proposed work. A number of alpha and beta testing results will be documented by this task, which will be conducted after the delivery of each module and provide quantitative results.</dct:description>

In a second development iteration, we will extend to subscription and notification service for GeoKnow with an API adhering to the Open-social standard. Based on this API, individuals and organisations can be informed on spatial knowledge updates performed by their social neighbourhood.

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">The first focus of WP7 is the dissemination of the project results supported by community building and cross-fertilisation activities.
Both the industrial and the academic partners will play active roles in dissemination. For the use case partners, the case studies will form a key part of the dissemination activity. For the academic partners, consultancy to business and contractual research and development will be a significant part of dissemination, besides the normal channels of publications, conference papers, workshop organisation, and educational courses at university sites.
The dissemination programme foresees a multi-channel dissemination approach. First, the project outcomes will be disseminated by use of publicly available channels – such as workshop, conference, magazine, and journal publications. These will be aimed at sharing the results of the project with the scientific community, particularly the European, but also the international scientific community, to encourage their incorporation into the work of other scientists and technologists. Complementing this, there will be a programme of papers and articles in IT, Web Technologies and general business publications, and presentations at geo data, library, IT and business expos and conferences (e.g. LinkedDataPlanet, KM Europe, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), Digital Curation Conference, CeBIT or Systems for telecommunication and IT) particularly targeted at the European Union and associated countries. We envisage that the innovative technology required for building spatial Linked Data applications, and the resulting open GeoKnow Generator, will be of great interest to both SMEs and large businesses alike.
We will put a special focus on demonstration activities in different forms of the possibilities that the newly developed technologies will offer. Target audience will be relevant industry and research actors whose main focus is the development of data and knowledge management systems, new scalable collaboration paradigms and their combination with information retrieval. The participation of globally acting partners (Ontos, OpenLink, BROX) will provide an additional, global dimension to our dissemination programme, in particular with Unister and Openlink as a globally acting E-Commerce and software vendor with offices in the US, and major European countries. Taking advantage of its worldwide unique information infrastructure, with products for enterprise information management, Unister can provide current research and technological solutions developed by the GeoKnow partners an ideal environment for demonstrating their real added value. The GeoKnow consortium will organize two end-user and industry days, one for each of the two case study applications corporate spatial business intelligence and e-science.
The project will set up and maintain an external Web site, which will function as a project dissemination tool, as a training portal and as a server demonstrating some of the project results. The Web site will itself be based on a Semantic Wiki system, so that project participants and interested users can register and be notified when new deliverables or software become available. Within the limitations imposed by appropriate protection of intellectual property, all major scientific results of this project will be made available to the research community, whilst the GeoKnow and components will be published as open source to facilitate take-up. Outcomes will be made available in a non-proprietary format. All open source components published will be extensively documented by means of textual documents and screencasts of professional quality illustrating how to download, install and operate the components in question. Documentation manuals and screencasts will be specifically identified as project deliverables and prominently published on the project&apos;s web site. The project will exploit modern, social-networking dissemination channels such as Weblogs, Newsfeeds (RSS), organize GeoKnow groups in social networks such as LinkedIn, XING, Facebook, Twine. The project will register its web site under the .eu domain for at least 2 years after the natural contractual end of the project and commit to keeping the web site alive for that period of time. It will link to other relevant EC and EC sponsored sites. 
The project will also deliver one or more web-based showcases and grant the EC the right to use the showcase(s) for its own dissemination and awareness activities. After the completion of the project. The Showcase(s) will feature a meaningful subset (software, data, etc.) of the functionality characterising the project demonstrator(s) arrived at, along with relevant copyright notices and contact information, and suitable installation aids and run-time interfaces.
GeoKnow will create a Researcher Early Access Group that will be open to participation to scientists working in related fields. Members of this group will get early access to project infrastructure and will be invited to experiment with GeoKnow components. This will both verify the generality of the plug-in interfaces and encourage take-up of the project results. The scientific communities that will be targeted by our inter-disciplinary community building efforts are very diverse and hitherto largely independent of each other: Geodata Management, Semantic Web and knowledge technologies, machine learning, e-science, and Big Data Management. 
In the first month of the project, the GeoKnow consortium will create a fact sheet suitable for Web publishing. The Fact Sheet will outline the project&apos;s rationale and objectives, specify its technical baseline and intended target groups and application domains, and detail intermediate and final outputs. The facts-sheet will be maintained and updated until the end of the project; this will be documented in the regular dissemination reports. It will be published on the website and related EC sponsored websites controlled by the consortium. Related to the fact sheet, the consortium will issue press releases within one month of the start of the project (prepared by InfAI and Ontos, translation and dissemination by all partners). The press releases will target the local or national press of all partners. The press release will describe the goals of the project in simple, jargon free language and whenever possible highlight the benefits to the region/country and the importance of the local partner being part of a EU consortium. A PDF version of the collection of such press releases will be listed as part of Deliverable D7.1.1. 
If suitable, the consortium may commit to radio and TV appearances. If this is feasible audio/video clips will also be submitted as additional deliverables.
Additionally, we plan to promote cross-fertilisation through inter-disciplinary workshops, organized alongside major conferences in the respective research fields. The GeoKnow partners representing each of these diverse research areas will be responsible to promote the project results within the respective communities. The project partners undertake – when invited – to contribute to and participate in focused concertation actions, themed seminars or special interest groups.</dct:description>

The pillars of GeoKnow exploitation strategy are: tracking important technical and commercial developments in geo data management, semantic web, Web 2.0 as well as geospatial e-science and enterprise applications; analyzing the market sector(s) where the results can be applied and possibly licensed commercially; identifying the results of GeoKnow that are exploitable: particularly the GeoKnow Generator, some of the components and the innovative applications developed within the use cases; and identifying the appropriate distribution channels (including open source community) to exploit the different results of the project.
The major outcome of this work package will be the GeoKnow Exploitation Plan, which will include a list of opportunities that arise from GeoKnow scientific and technical achievements and a detailed analysis of benefit and impact for the GeoKnow consortium as a whole as well as for the results of individual participants. The prestige of both the industrial partners and the use case partners makes the GeoKnow Consortium an international partnership.</dct:description>

      xmlns:ns9="dcterms:">This use case will target the Enterprise Data Integration domain and adapt the GeoKnow platform for facilitation the establishment of an Enterprise Data Intra- and Extranet. BROX, OpenLink and Ontos are with Eccenca, Virtuoso and Ontos Miner developing products for Enterprise Data integration. In this use case, we will refine and advance the integration of the GeoKnow platform in such a way, that Enterprise users can use the resulting technology stack to establish spatial linked data driven supply chains as a crystallization point for the establishment of a Data Extranet in addition to existing document-oriented Extranets.

One of the most promising application areas for spatial Linked Data is supporting the supply chain. Large manufacturers such as for example Volkswagen or Daimler have many thousands of suppliers rendering the information flows accompanying these supply chains (or networks) a real Big Data challenge. Facilitating the information flows between these suppliers and accompanying flows of material and product logistics is one of the most challenging and most promising areas of Enterprise Data Integration.

The aim of this use case will be to give enterprises collaborating in supply chains a unified spatial view on the logistics in the supply chain. In order to realize this aim, we will connect information stored in RFIDs to the Data Web. As a result, the flow of material and accompanying information can be observed in real-time, bottlenecks can be identified early, media breaks in the information flows are minimized and supply chains can be organized at an unprecedented level of dynamicity and efficiency.

The use case will be implemented and prototypically deployed at a large scale supply chain environment in close collaboration with BROXâ€™s partner Schnellecke. Schnellecke has more than 14,000 employees at more than 40 company sites worldwide, Schnellecke contributes to the corporate success of its customers through the development and implementation of tailored logistics solutions and optimized value-added chains. Schnellecke is the worldwide leading value-adding logistics service provider in the automotive industry (cf. letter of support in the Appendix). The following two screenshots illustrate the vision pursued in this use case: employing a combination of map and faceted-browsing (left), logistics managers are empowered to track and supervise supply chain flows in real time. Each item and geo-location is equipped with additional structured data (right), which is obtained from a SPARQL endpoint. The information displayed on such a supply chain dashboard is aggregated from a number of different information sources. Background knowledge from the Data Web (such LinkedGeoData) is used to enrich the information obtained from the SPARQL endpoints of the partners in the supply chain as well as for providing a spatial context. Such sources include in particular LinkedGeoData (e.g. providing precise road network, land use and building information), Geonames (providing information on administrative regions) and DBpedia, which contains, for example, information about train stations, airports and other facilities. Also, data obtained from Open Governmental Data sources can be useful here.                                                                                           </ns9:abstract>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The first focus of WP7 is the dissemination of the project results supported by community building and cross-fertilisation activities.
Both the industrial and the academic partners will play active roles in dissemination. For the use case partners, the case studies will form a key part of the dissemination activity. For the academic partners, consultancy to business and contractual research and development will be a significant part of dissemination, besides the normal channels of publications, conference papers, workshop organisation, and educational courses at university sites.
The dissemination programme foresees a multi-channel dissemination approach. First, the project outcomes will be disseminated by use of publicly available channels â€“ such as workshop, conference, magazine, and journal publications. These will be aimed at sharing the results of the project with the scientific community, particularly the European, but also the international scientific community, to encourage their incorporation into the work of other scientists and technologists. Complementing this, there will be a programme of papers and articles in IT, Web Technologies and general business publications, and presentations at geo data, library, IT and business expos and conferences (e.g. LinkedDataPlanet, KM Europe, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), Digital Curation Conference, CeBIT or Systems for telecommunication and IT) particularly targeted at the European Union and associated countries. We envisage that the innovative technology required for building spatial Linked Data applications, and the resulting open GeoKnow Generator, will be of great interest to both SMEs and large businesses alike.
We will put a special focus on demonstration activities in different forms of the possibilities that the newly developed technologies will offer. Target audience will be relevant industry and research actors whose main focus is the development of data and knowledge management systems, new scalable collaboration paradigms and their combination with information retrieval. The participation of globally acting partners (Ontos, OpenLink, BROX) will provide an additional, global dimension to our dissemination programme, in particular with Unister and Openlink as a globally acting E-Commerce and software vendor with offices in the US, and major European countries. Taking advantage of its worldwide unique information infrastructure, with products for enterprise information management, Unister can provide current research and technological solutions developed by the GeoKnow partners an ideal environment for demonstrating their real added value. The GeoKnow consortium will organize two end-user and industry days, one for each of the two case study applications corporate spatial business intelligence and e-science.
The project will set up and maintain an external Web site, which will function as a project dissemination tool, as a training portal and as a server demonstrating some of the project results. The Web site will itself be based on a Semantic Wiki system, so that project participants and interested users can register and be notified when new deliverables or software become available. Within the limitations imposed by appropriate protection of intellectual property, all major scientific results of this project will be made available to the research community, whilst the GeoKnow and components will be published as open source to facilitate take-up. Outcomes will be made available in a non-proprietary format. All open source components published will be extensively documented by means of textual documents and screencasts of professional quality illustrating how to download, install and operate the components in question. Documentation manuals and screencasts will be specifically identified as project deliverables and prominently published on the project&apos;s web site. The project will exploit modern, social-networking dissemination channels such as Weblogs, Newsfeeds (RSS), organize GeoKnow groups in social networks such as LinkedIn, XING, Facebook, Twine. The project will register its web site under the .eu domain for at least 2 years after the natural contractual end of the project and commit to keeping the web site alive for that period of time. It will link to other relevant EC and EC sponsored sites. 
The project will also deliver one or more web-based showcases and grant the EC the right to use the showcase(s) for its own dissemination and awareness activities. After the completion of the project. The Showcase(s) will feature a meaningful subset (software, data, etc.) of the functionality characterising the project demonstrator(s) arrived at, along with relevant copyright notices and contact information, and suitable installation aids and run-time interfaces.
GeoKnow will create a Researcher Early Access Group that will be open to participation to scientists working in related fields. Members of this group will get early access to project infrastructure and will be invited to experiment with GeoKnow components. This will both verify the generality of the plug-in interfaces and encourage take-up of the project results. The scientific communities that will be targeted by our inter-disciplinary community building efforts are very diverse and hitherto largely independent of each other: Geodata Management, Semantic Web and knowledge technologies, machine learning, e-science, and Big Data Management. 
In the first month of the project, the GeoKnow consortium will create a fact sheet suitable for Web publishing. The Fact Sheet will outline the project&apos;s rationale and objectives, specify its technical baseline and intended target groups and application domains, and detail intermediate and final outputs. The facts-sheet will be maintained and updated until the end of the project; this will be documented in the regular dissemination reports. It will be published on the website and related EC sponsored websites controlled by the consortium. Related to the fact sheet, the consortium will issue press releases within one month of the start of the project (prepared by InfAI and Ontos, translation and dissemination by all partners). The press releases will target the local or national press of all partners. The press release will describe the goals of the project in simple, jargon free language and whenever possible highlight the benefits to the region/country and the importance of the local partner being part of a EU consortium. A PDF version of the collection of such press releases will be listed as part of Deliverable D7.1.1. 
If suitable, the consortium may commit to radio and TV appearances. If this is feasible audio/video clips will also be submitted as additional deliverables.
Additionally, we plan to promote cross-fertilisation through inter-disciplinary workshops, organized alongside major conferences in the respective research fields. The GeoKnow partners representing each of these diverse research areas will be responsible to promote the project results within the respective communities. The project partners undertake â€“ when invited â€“ to contribute to and participate in focused concertation actions, themed seminars or special interest groups.</rdfs:comment>
