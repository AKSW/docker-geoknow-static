    <dct:description>The adaptive nature of the information structures in GKS is particularly challenging for the provisioning of easy-to-use, yet comprehensive user interfaces. In a GKS users are not constraint by a rigid data model, but can use any representation of information adhering to the RDF data model. This can include information represented according to heterogeneous, interconnected vocabularies defined and published on the Data Web, as well as newly defined attributes and classification structures. Hence, the GKS user interface components should support the reuse of existing vocabularies and ontologies as well as the Ad hoc definition of new ones and their refinement and evolution over time. Different information structures should be seamlessly combinable in a single visualisation or authoring environment, even if the information to be visualized or authored is obtained or stored in various GKS and other Linked Data sources. The objectives of the WP4 are to develop (1) new exploration, (2) visualisation and (3) authoring &amp; curation interfaces for GKS, which support a wide range of devices (from mobile phones to desktop PCs), which integrate heterogeneous information from various sources and support the evolution of both instance data as well as information structures over time. In order to achieve these objectives we will explore new exploration and visualisation paradigms. For example, we will extend facetted browsing techniques such that the facetted browsing can be combined with the spatial dimension. Regarding visualisation, we will explore new map overlay techniques, which allow to layer and combine (possible aggregated) semantic information together with different map rendering approaches (e.g. for pedestrians, bi-cyclists, disabled and challenged persons).</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">In this task we will develop a reusable components for visualizing and exploring spatial content. The component will consist of a library of different spatial-semantic visualization and exploration components:
A slippy map, which allows users to zoom-to and select a certain geographical area. The slippy map will be based on existing Web map implementations, such as for example OpenLayers1 from Open Source Geospatial Foundation. The implementation will be extended to allow an overlaying of the displayed raster maps with additional information represented in vector formats, such as various types of markers, polygons and curves. 
A facet filtering component, which displays (a hierarchy of) semantic facets detected in conjunction with the selected map area. Only facets, which have respective adhering objects in the selected area as well as the overall number of objects adhering to each facet in the selected area will be displayed. Depending on the facet type, different selection widgets will allow to specify eligible facet-constraints, e.g date and number ranges and enumeration of facet values.
A result view, which lists in addition to markers and regions on the map the retrieved objects adhering to the selected facets. For each individual object in the result set, its properties can be displayed in a configurable way. It will be possible to define templates for the visual presentation of certain spatial objects, e.g. train stations, cities, parks etc. Based on existing vocabularies such templates will display semantic information in a customizable and domain specific way. 
The components’ usability will be evaluated in the context of their integration into the portals of the project partners, as described in WP5 and WP6. For this reason, we do not plan to evaluate the usability of the widgets “on their own”, as this will be covered by the respective reports. The evaluation findings will be considered for further developments and improvements of the components.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">In this task, we will develop two components for the authoring and curation of spatial-semantic content. Firstly, we will specify a spatial-semantic widget interface, which will allow the creation of small reusable interface components for the creation of domain-specific user-interfaces. The widgets will be RDFa annotated HTML fragments together with JavaScript and CSS code. This will allow one to reuse them in various development environments, as for instance J2EE, LAMP, and Dot.Net. The widget interface definition will contain a number of event handlers, style classes, JavaScript functions, which concrete implementations must support. Widgets should be composeable out of existing smaller ones. For example, a widget for creating train stations, could be composed out of widgets for selecting a certain location and ones for representing object type, associating train lines etc. As part of this task we will develop a library of reusable widgets and common utilities.
In order to enable the curation of spatial-semantic knowledge, we will develop an interface allowing to curate (i.e. annotation or modification) single spatial objects or complete sets of spatial objects. The curation of sets of objects will start with a search and faceted-refinement. Subsequently, all retrieved spatial entities can be updated in a single step thus mimicking data cleansing tools from the database and ETL world.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">One of the main innovations of GeoKnow will be the development of a co-evolution approach, which facilitates the synchronized evolution of spatial Linked Open Data sources and company internal data (e.g. E-Commerce data in WP6). Our approach will be based on a declarative definition of evolution patterns, which will ensure, that changes made on imported Linked Open Data sources during the curation process will prevail after these sources are newly downloaded and updated from the Web of Data. This technology will enable any data consumer to select relevant parts of datasets and transform them as needed, thereby retaining the possibility to easily (re)synchronize with the sources should they change. The same technology can also be used by the maintainers of the source data sets for incorporating third party changes, such as fixes, that were made public. The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive Enterprise knowledge hub (similarly to DBpedia on the Web of Data), which is connected with all major data and knowledge bases relevant for the enterprise and which constitutes a crystallization point for the organizational knowledge of a company.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">In this task, we will implement social networking interfaces for the authoring components of the GeoKnow Generator. The interfaces will be implemented in two steps, first we integrate a subscription and notification service into the GeoKnow Generator, which will enable users to subscribe to arbitrary information adhering to certain spatial or semantically defined filter criteria. In a second development iteration, we will extend to subscription and notification service for GeoKnow with an API adhering to the Open-social standard. Based on this API, individuals and organisations can be informed on spatial knowledge updates performed by their social neighbourhood. The spatial social networking component is particularly important for the supply chain integration features of WP5.</dct:description>

    <dct:description rdf:datatype="&sysont;Markdown">The goal of this task is to develop a mobile version of the spatial‐semantic visualization and exploration component described in Task 4.1, with an additional authoring component that will allow for online updates of geospatial and related information by a user on the move. The tool will give the user the ability to load the application with a custom dataset through one of the available SPARQL endpoints and retrieve the data they might be interested in on request, instead of (over)loading the mobile map with irrelevant information from the start. The user interface will consist of:

-  A slippy map component, used for quick and easy exploration of geographical areas, showing the user’s own position (GPS coordinates) and the surrounding area. The component will possibly be based on the extended OpenLayers map that is to be built in Task 4.1, but other mobile geospatial platforms will be considered as well.
- A semantic facet filtering component and a result view, similar to the desktop/webbased components described in Task 4.1.
- An authoring component, used for quick editing of existing information (e.g. fixing outdated information) and adding new information on the move. The tool will be available on at least one major mobile platform (Android, iOS, Windows Phone) in order to reach a larger target population and spark community engagement and contribution. As the resulting software solution will be used as a basis for Task 5.6, joint evaluation and testing activities for both components will be performed within Task 5.5 and reported on in Deliverable 5.5. The main reason for the allocation of persons months for InfAI in this task is to: a) transfer knowledge from Task 4.1 to this task (including support in the implementation phase) and b) combine IMP’s expertise with InfAI’s expertise to further improve the quality of achieved results.</dct:description>

Data (aggregated, interlinked with public datasets and fused) will appear at different levels of granularity, thus, imposing challenges for data processing, presentation and exploration. In order to achieve standard representation of data, special quality assessment services will be developed for vocabularies such as Core Business (http://www.w3.org/ns/legal#), Core Location (http://www.w3.org/ns/locn#) and the RDF Data Cube vocabulary (http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab‐data‐cube/). For business users interested in spatial analysis of different statistical indicators, an advanced GUI will be developed that will allow drill‐down style online access to highly granular data. The whole geospatial information life cycle in the resulting GeoKnow Prototype for Exploratory Spatiotemporal Analysis will be tested with data that is to be provided by the Serbian Business Registers Agency (http://www.apr.gov.rs), and different statistical indicators published by the Serbian Statistical Office at the Serbian CKAN (http://rs.ckan.net). The Serbian Business Registers Agency is an indispensable primary source of official public and other information on business entities in Serbia (50.000+ website visitors a day, 1M+ a month). A letter of commitment is provided. The Statistical Office of Serbia is special professional organization in the system of state administration of the Republic of Serbia that performs a wide range of expert tasks stipulated by the law.

Thus, we target the following objectives: (1) We develop self-configuring algorithms to interlink data sets with spatial dimensions. The results are new connections between previously not directly connected data sets sharing a set of commonly referred spatial objects. (2) We elaborate algorithms to fuse existing spatial RDF data sets. The result will be derived datasets with consistent representations of geometry and meta data of spatial objects. (3) We develop metrics to compare different maps and different regions of a map for their coverage of objects, density, divergence of geometry, pertinence of categories and topicality of meta data. (4) We elaborate methods and algorithms to aggregate consolidated information from volunteered geospatial data.</dct:description>

      xmlns:ns9="dcterms:">This use case will target the Enterprise Data Integration domain and adapt the GeoKnow platform for facilitation the establishment of an Enterprise Data Intra- and Extranet. BROX, OpenLink and Ontos are with Eccenca, Virtuoso and Ontos Miner developing products for Enterprise Data integration. In this use case, we will refine and advance the integration of the GeoKnow platform in such a way, that Enterprise users can use the resulting technology stack to establish spatial linked data driven supply chains as a crystallization point for the establishment of a Data Extranet in addition to existing document-oriented Extranets.

One of the most promising application areas for spatial Linked Data is supporting the supply chain. Large manufacturers such as for example Volkswagen or Daimler have many thousands of suppliers rendering the information flows accompanying these supply chains (or networks) a real Big Data challenge. Facilitating the information flows between these suppliers and accompanying flows of material and product logistics is one of the most challenging and most promising areas of Enterprise Data Integration.

The aim of this use case will be to give enterprises collaborating in supply chains a unified spatial view on the logistics in the supply chain. In order to realize this aim, we will connect information stored in RFIDs to the Data Web. As a result, the flow of material and accompanying information can be observed in real-time, bottlenecks can be identified early, media breaks in the information flows are minimized and supply chains can be organized at an unprecedented level of dynamicity and efficiency.

The use case will be implemented and prototypically deployed at a large scale supply chain environment in close collaboration with BROXâ€™s partner Schnellecke. Schnellecke has more than 14,000 employees at more than 40 company sites worldwide, Schnellecke contributes to the corporate success of its customers through the development and implementation of tailored logistics solutions and optimized value-added chains. Schnellecke is the worldwide leading value-adding logistics service provider in the automotive industry (cf. letter of support in the Appendix). The following two screenshots illustrate the vision pursued in this use case: employing a combination of map and faceted-browsing (left), logistics managers are empowered to track and supervise supply chain flows in real time. Each item and geo-location is equipped with additional structured data (right), which is obtained from a SPARQL endpoint. The information displayed on such a supply chain dashboard is aggregated from a number of different information sources. Background knowledge from the Data Web (such LinkedGeoData) is used to enrich the information obtained from the SPARQL endpoints of the partners in the supply chain as well as for providing a spatial context. Such sources include in particular LinkedGeoData (e.g. providing precise road network, land use and building information), Geonames (providing information on administrative regions) and DBpedia, which contains, for example, information about train stations, airports and other facilities. Also, data obtained from Open Governmental Data sources can be useful here.                                                                                           </ns9:abstract>
