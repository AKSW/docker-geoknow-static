    rdfs:label="GeoKnow">
    <ns8:abstract xml:lang="en">The advent of the Data Web demonstrates how Web technologies can be employed to integrate dispersed, heterogeneous information. Most information - be it the extent of habitats of aquatic species, data warehouses of E-Commerce systems or offerings of the bakery shop next door - has a directly or indirectly associated spatial dimension. Integrating and efficiently using information with such a spatial dimension on the Web poses very particular challenges. 
First, we have to combine and reason about spatial and semantic features that use different vocabularies and representation techniques. Second, the wealth of pre-existing overlapping and complementary information sources in the spatial domain demands information management able to deal with billions of facts in a scalable manner. Third, only by dramatically lowering the entrance barriers extra value can be generated through the involvement of thousands of non-expert end users in authoring, curation and assessment. Within GeoKnow, we will tackle these challenges and spur the transition from islands of isolated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to a Web of interlinked Geographic Knowledge Systems (GKS).
We will validate our approach in two complementary application scenarios: (1) spatial-semantic collaboration in biological scientific communities involving citizen scientists and (2) spatial-semantic travel E-Commerce data management.
GeoKnow will substantially contribute to the evolution of the Web from a medium for information exchange to a medium for (spatial) knowledge integration, e.g. the number of spatial LOD sources will increase from 31to &gt;1,000. GeoKnow will help to realize network effects by increasing quality and coherence of the spatial Data Web, e.g. the data-linkage ratio will increase from 5% to 20%. For enterprises, the GeoKnow Generator will provide a cost-efficient way to integrate a variety of heterogeneous information sources within an Enterprise Data Intranet.</ns8:abstract>

    <dct:description rdf:datatype="&sysont;Markdown">This task is devoted to specifying the GeoKnow architecture and the detailed design of the GeoKnow Generator. Scalability, extensibility and flexibility shall be achieved by employing Service Oriented Knowledge Utilities (SOKU) in order to develop next generation GKS. Components of the system will be building blocks developed in individual work packages WP2-4, such as the semantics based geo-spatial information management subsystem (WP2), spatial knowledge fusing and integration methods (WP3), the development of user interfaces for spatial-semantic browsing and authoring (WP4). The developed components will be integrated within this task. While the common technical requirements will be one major input for the system design, other major sources will be the developed use cases and end user requirements as well as interoperability standards.
The system design defines clear interfaces between the individual components. It will be based on existing standards and will provide a modular plug’n’serve structure and shall be able to accommodate REST components and JavaScript user interface widgets. The architecture will be centred around the OWL/RDF-statement paradigm, which enables interactions between components on different conceptual levels, such as triples, classes and instances, ontologies, logical axioms etc.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">A benchmarking strategy will be developed and the platforms performance will be evaluated, based on well-established benchmarks, such as the Sequoia 2000 and Paradise benchmark3. In particular, the benchmark will be based on OSM and Natural Earth datasets, complemented by synthetic social data from the LOD2 Social Intelligence Benchmark. Further, to perform benchmarking tests that can deal with very large datasets, we will develop a suitable infrastructure by (1) evaluating existing high-performant and compact GIS storage formats for adoption of best practices (e.g. Oracle Spatial, PostGIS), (2) developing a suitable process for extract-transform-load of geo data, including coordinate transforms and schema mapping (e.g. GDAL/OGR, GeoKettle). This is in itself a matter of benchmarking but also enables running benchmarks targeting diverse geospatial workloads such as localized, potentially high frequency accesses for route planning and querying; as well as aggregation queries that span large portions of the map and join with thematic data.

The Sequoia workload is an initial checklist item for validating functionality and relative performance as opposed to existing GIS. Geoknow will move beyond the state of the art by using and further refining the geospatial benchmark built in LOD2, emulating heavy drill-down style online access patterns and accessing large volumes of thematic data. An example of this is zooming on a map shaded according to population density or real estate prices. Beyond this, benchmarking will look at more complex analytics such as deciding locations of services based on population distribution, competitive services, road network capacity and the like. The last category is not expressible as a query but requires database resident application logic.

Further, to compare GKS and its components with other state of the art systems, we will use the SEALS project benchmarking services. This will provide us with an objective evaluation of the GKS and its components.

Benchmarks will be done early, so as to provide constant tracking of performance.
Virtuoso&apos;s relational GIS functionality will be compared to PostGIS using the full scale OSM data and typical OSM queries and updates. Further, an RDF version of this will be run on Virtuoso and its performance will be compared to the performance attained with OSM in relational form on Virtuoso.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">During this task individual components developed in WP2-4 will be integrated into a ready to use GKS Generator and associated APIs in order to enable communities of practice to create domain specific GKSes with a minimum of effort. For example, chosing between map providers (e.g. OpenStreetMap, Google Maps) will require no coding, and there will be a widget library, based on the use-cases, with some widgets (e.g. for place searches, ratings, images and facts) being usable across multiple domains. A plug-in system will ensure that new styles and behaviour can be added in case none of the provided components turn out to be applicable.
Thus, this task consists of the following subtasks:
Integration of User Interface Components. The goal of this sub-task is to provide rich GUIs for social-aware GKS applications. 
Integration of GeoKnow Generator and API. The objective of this sub-task is to integrate the GeoKnow components developed in WP2-4 and the Web 2.0 toolkit into a ready to use GKS Generator with underlying service APIs. Within this task we will perform software integration activities together with WP2-4. 
Testing, documentation &amp; tutorials. This sub-task will take the end-user and technical feedbacks resulting from WP5-6 into account to improve the final GeoKnow Generator and provide documentation and tutorials. The documentation of the evaluation should provide both quantitative and qualitative results, through real-life trials of the proposed work. A number of alpha and beta testing results will be documented by this task, which will be conducted after the delivery of each module and provide quantitative results.</dct:description>

Second, we will document and analyze the support of existing semantic repositories for the aforementioned spatial representations. Third, we will design and execute analytical benchmarks to compare the performance and real-world relevance of current semantic repositories toFLOSS and proprietary geospatial databases (e.g. PostGIS, Oracle Spatial). Specifically, we will use Open Street Map data as a very large data source, and typical geospatial queries performed by the OSM community as workloads. Our findings will establish a baseline for evaluating performance and scaling attributes of current approaches, and provide quantitative metrics for evaluating the performance of prototypes produced later in the project.</dct:description>

While in WP2 we are developing the infrastructure for fusing geospatial data sets, this task has the goal to develop the algorithms necessary for fusing different RDF representations of maps.

While it helps new contributors to guide with suggestions for categories to be instantiated on a map more experienced users will want to add new categories at their wish. 
In this task we aim at consolidating the type of information entered in volunteered geographic knowledge bases not by restricting the set of categories but rather:
develop algorithms semantically consolidating the meaning of categories. We aim at developing algorithms automatically mapping newly added categories to existing categories. The user has then the choice to reuse an existing definition of a well described and frequently used category or begin to define a new category. Newly added categories will be grouped with other categories into higher types of categories.
investigate in a community driven consolidation process. Since we are aware that an algorithmic approach will not solve the problem entirely, the goal is to develop means to define aggregated categories and allow the community to agree on them.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">The first focus of WP7 is the dissemination of the project results supported by community building and cross-fertilisation activities.
Both the industrial and the academic partners will play active roles in dissemination. For the use case partners, the case studies will form a key part of the dissemination activity. For the academic partners, consultancy to business and contractual research and development will be a significant part of dissemination, besides the normal channels of publications, conference papers, workshop organisation, and educational courses at university sites.
The dissemination programme foresees a multi-channel dissemination approach. First, the project outcomes will be disseminated by use of publicly available channels – such as workshop, conference, magazine, and journal publications. These will be aimed at sharing the results of the project with the scientific community, particularly the European, but also the international scientific community, to encourage their incorporation into the work of other scientists and technologists. Complementing this, there will be a programme of papers and articles in IT, Web Technologies and general business publications, and presentations at geo data, library, IT and business expos and conferences (e.g. LinkedDataPlanet, KM Europe, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), Digital Curation Conference, CeBIT or Systems for telecommunication and IT) particularly targeted at the European Union and associated countries. We envisage that the innovative technology required for building spatial Linked Data applications, and the resulting open GeoKnow Generator, will be of great interest to both SMEs and large businesses alike.
We will put a special focus on demonstration activities in different forms of the possibilities that the newly developed technologies will offer. Target audience will be relevant industry and research actors whose main focus is the development of data and knowledge management systems, new scalable collaboration paradigms and their combination with information retrieval. The participation of globally acting partners (Ontos, OpenLink, BROX) will provide an additional, global dimension to our dissemination programme, in particular with Unister and Openlink as a globally acting E-Commerce and software vendor with offices in the US, and major European countries. Taking advantage of its worldwide unique information infrastructure, with products for enterprise information management, Unister can provide current research and technological solutions developed by the GeoKnow partners an ideal environment for demonstrating their real added value. The GeoKnow consortium will organize two end-user and industry days, one for each of the two case study applications corporate spatial business intelligence and e-science.
The project will set up and maintain an external Web site, which will function as a project dissemination tool, as a training portal and as a server demonstrating some of the project results. The Web site will itself be based on a Semantic Wiki system, so that project participants and interested users can register and be notified when new deliverables or software become available. Within the limitations imposed by appropriate protection of intellectual property, all major scientific results of this project will be made available to the research community, whilst the GeoKnow and components will be published as open source to facilitate take-up. Outcomes will be made available in a non-proprietary format. All open source components published will be extensively documented by means of textual documents and screencasts of professional quality illustrating how to download, install and operate the components in question. Documentation manuals and screencasts will be specifically identified as project deliverables and prominently published on the project&apos;s web site. The project will exploit modern, social-networking dissemination channels such as Weblogs, Newsfeeds (RSS), organize GeoKnow groups in social networks such as LinkedIn, XING, Facebook, Twine. The project will register its web site under the .eu domain for at least 2 years after the natural contractual end of the project and commit to keeping the web site alive for that period of time. It will link to other relevant EC and EC sponsored sites. 
The project will also deliver one or more web-based showcases and grant the EC the right to use the showcase(s) for its own dissemination and awareness activities. After the completion of the project. The Showcase(s) will feature a meaningful subset (software, data, etc.) of the functionality characterising the project demonstrator(s) arrived at, along with relevant copyright notices and contact information, and suitable installation aids and run-time interfaces.
GeoKnow will create a Researcher Early Access Group that will be open to participation to scientists working in related fields. Members of this group will get early access to project infrastructure and will be invited to experiment with GeoKnow components. This will both verify the generality of the plug-in interfaces and encourage take-up of the project results. The scientific communities that will be targeted by our inter-disciplinary community building efforts are very diverse and hitherto largely independent of each other: Geodata Management, Semantic Web and knowledge technologies, machine learning, e-science, and Big Data Management. 
In the first month of the project, the GeoKnow consortium will create a fact sheet suitable for Web publishing. The Fact Sheet will outline the project&apos;s rationale and objectives, specify its technical baseline and intended target groups and application domains, and detail intermediate and final outputs. The facts-sheet will be maintained and updated until the end of the project; this will be documented in the regular dissemination reports. It will be published on the website and related EC sponsored websites controlled by the consortium. Related to the fact sheet, the consortium will issue press releases within one month of the start of the project (prepared by InfAI and Ontos, translation and dissemination by all partners). The press releases will target the local or national press of all partners. The press release will describe the goals of the project in simple, jargon free language and whenever possible highlight the benefits to the region/country and the importance of the local partner being part of a EU consortium. A PDF version of the collection of such press releases will be listed as part of Deliverable D7.1.1. 
If suitable, the consortium may commit to radio and TV appearances. If this is feasible audio/video clips will also be submitted as additional deliverables.
Additionally, we plan to promote cross-fertilisation through inter-disciplinary workshops, organized alongside major conferences in the respective research fields. The GeoKnow partners representing each of these diverse research areas will be responsible to promote the project results within the respective communities. The project partners undertake – when invited – to contribute to and participate in focused concertation actions, themed seminars or special interest groups.</dct:description>

The pillars of GeoKnow exploitation strategy are: tracking important technical and commercial developments in geo data management, semantic web, Web 2.0 as well as geospatial e-science and enterprise applications; analyzing the market sector(s) where the results can be applied and possibly licensed commercially; identifying the results of GeoKnow that are exploitable: particularly the GeoKnow Generator, some of the components and the innovative applications developed within the use cases; and identifying the appropriate distribution channels (including open source community) to exploit the different results of the project.
The major outcome of this work package will be the GeoKnow Exploitation Plan, which will include a list of opportunities that arise from GeoKnow scientific and technical achievements and a detailed analysis of benefit and impact for the GeoKnow consortium as a whole as well as for the results of individual participants. The prestige of both the industrial partners and the use case partners makes the GeoKnow Consortium an international partnership.</dct:description>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A benchmarking strategy will be developed and the platforms performance will be evaluated, based on well-established benchmarks, such as the Sequoia 2000 and Paradise benchmark3. In particular, the benchmark will be based on OSM and Natural Earth datasets, complemented by synthetic social data from the LOD2 Social Intelligence Benchmark. Further, to perform benchmarking tests that can deal with very large datasets, we will develop a suitable infrastructure by (1) evaluating existing high-performant and compact GIS storage formats for adoption of best practices (e.g. Oracle Spatial, PostGIS), (2) developing a suitable process for extract-transform-load of geo data, including coordinate transforms and schema mapping (e.g. GDAL/OGR, GeoKettle). This is in itself a matter of benchmarking but also enables running benchmarks targeting diverse geospatial workloads such as localized, potentially high frequency accesses for route planning and querying; as well as aggregation queries that span large portions of the map and join with thematic data.

The Sequoia workload is an initial checklist item for validating functionality and relative performance as opposed to existing GIS. Geoknow will move beyond the state of the art by using and further refining the geospatial benchmark built in LOD2, emulating heavy drill-down style online access patterns and accessing large volumes of thematic data. An example of this is zooming on a map shaded according to population density or real estate prices. Beyond this, benchmarking will look at more complex analytics such as deciding locations of services based on population distribution, competitive services, road network capacity and the like. The last category is not expressible as a query but requires database resident application logic.

Further, to compare GKS and its components with other state of the art systems, we will use the SEALS project benchmarking services. This will provide us with an objective evaluation of the GKS and its components.

Benchmarks will be done early, so as to provide constant tracking of performance.
Virtuoso&apos;s relational GIS functionality will be compared to PostGIS using the full scale OSM data and typical OSM queries and updates. Further, an RDF version of this will be run on Virtuoso and its performance will be compared to the performance attained with OSM in relational form on Virtuoso.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The first focus of WP7 is the dissemination of the project results supported by community building and cross-fertilisation activities.
Both the industrial and the academic partners will play active roles in dissemination. For the use case partners, the case studies will form a key part of the dissemination activity. For the academic partners, consultancy to business and contractual research and development will be a significant part of dissemination, besides the normal channels of publications, conference papers, workshop organisation, and educational courses at university sites.
The dissemination programme foresees a multi-channel dissemination approach. First, the project outcomes will be disseminated by use of publicly available channels â€“ such as workshop, conference, magazine, and journal publications. These will be aimed at sharing the results of the project with the scientific community, particularly the European, but also the international scientific community, to encourage their incorporation into the work of other scientists and technologists. Complementing this, there will be a programme of papers and articles in IT, Web Technologies and general business publications, and presentations at geo data, library, IT and business expos and conferences (e.g. LinkedDataPlanet, KM Europe, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), Digital Curation Conference, CeBIT or Systems for telecommunication and IT) particularly targeted at the European Union and associated countries. We envisage that the innovative technology required for building spatial Linked Data applications, and the resulting open GeoKnow Generator, will be of great interest to both SMEs and large businesses alike.
We will put a special focus on demonstration activities in different forms of the possibilities that the newly developed technologies will offer. Target audience will be relevant industry and research actors whose main focus is the development of data and knowledge management systems, new scalable collaboration paradigms and their combination with information retrieval. The participation of globally acting partners (Ontos, OpenLink, BROX) will provide an additional, global dimension to our dissemination programme, in particular with Unister and Openlink as a globally acting E-Commerce and software vendor with offices in the US, and major European countries. Taking advantage of its worldwide unique information infrastructure, with products for enterprise information management, Unister can provide current research and technological solutions developed by the GeoKnow partners an ideal environment for demonstrating their real added value. The GeoKnow consortium will organize two end-user and industry days, one for each of the two case study applications corporate spatial business intelligence and e-science.
The project will set up and maintain an external Web site, which will function as a project dissemination tool, as a training portal and as a server demonstrating some of the project results. The Web site will itself be based on a Semantic Wiki system, so that project participants and interested users can register and be notified when new deliverables or software become available. Within the limitations imposed by appropriate protection of intellectual property, all major scientific results of this project will be made available to the research community, whilst the GeoKnow and components will be published as open source to facilitate take-up. Outcomes will be made available in a non-proprietary format. All open source components published will be extensively documented by means of textual documents and screencasts of professional quality illustrating how to download, install and operate the components in question. Documentation manuals and screencasts will be specifically identified as project deliverables and prominently published on the project&apos;s web site. The project will exploit modern, social-networking dissemination channels such as Weblogs, Newsfeeds (RSS), organize GeoKnow groups in social networks such as LinkedIn, XING, Facebook, Twine. The project will register its web site under the .eu domain for at least 2 years after the natural contractual end of the project and commit to keeping the web site alive for that period of time. It will link to other relevant EC and EC sponsored sites. 
The project will also deliver one or more web-based showcases and grant the EC the right to use the showcase(s) for its own dissemination and awareness activities. After the completion of the project. The Showcase(s) will feature a meaningful subset (software, data, etc.) of the functionality characterising the project demonstrator(s) arrived at, along with relevant copyright notices and contact information, and suitable installation aids and run-time interfaces.
GeoKnow will create a Researcher Early Access Group that will be open to participation to scientists working in related fields. Members of this group will get early access to project infrastructure and will be invited to experiment with GeoKnow components. This will both verify the generality of the plug-in interfaces and encourage take-up of the project results. The scientific communities that will be targeted by our inter-disciplinary community building efforts are very diverse and hitherto largely independent of each other: Geodata Management, Semantic Web and knowledge technologies, machine learning, e-science, and Big Data Management. 
In the first month of the project, the GeoKnow consortium will create a fact sheet suitable for Web publishing. The Fact Sheet will outline the project&apos;s rationale and objectives, specify its technical baseline and intended target groups and application domains, and detail intermediate and final outputs. The facts-sheet will be maintained and updated until the end of the project; this will be documented in the regular dissemination reports. It will be published on the website and related EC sponsored websites controlled by the consortium. Related to the fact sheet, the consortium will issue press releases within one month of the start of the project (prepared by InfAI and Ontos, translation and dissemination by all partners). The press releases will target the local or national press of all partners. The press release will describe the goals of the project in simple, jargon free language and whenever possible highlight the benefits to the region/country and the importance of the local partner being part of a EU consortium. A PDF version of the collection of such press releases will be listed as part of Deliverable D7.1.1. 
If suitable, the consortium may commit to radio and TV appearances. If this is feasible audio/video clips will also be submitted as additional deliverables.
Additionally, we plan to promote cross-fertilisation through inter-disciplinary workshops, organized alongside major conferences in the respective research fields. The GeoKnow partners representing each of these diverse research areas will be responsible to promote the project results within the respective communities. The project partners undertake â€“ when invited â€“ to contribute to and participate in focused concertation actions, themed seminars or special interest groups.</rdfs:comment>
