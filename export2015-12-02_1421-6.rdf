    <dct:description rdf:datatype="&sysont;Markdown">Universität Leipzig is one of the oldest (founded 1409) and largest (30.000 students) universities in Germany and focuses on interdisciplinary research in the life sciences, cognitive sciences and linguistics as well as mathematics and computer science. The Institute for Applied Computer Science (InfAI, http://infai.org) at Universität Leipzig hosts world class research groups in service sciences, knowledge engineering and management as well as web science. The approximately 20 researchers of the knowledge engineering research group (online at: http://aksw.org) at InfAI are establishing theoretical results and scalable implementations for the field. Particular emphasis is given to areas such as ontology creation and manipulation, knowledge extraction, ontology learning and information &amp; data integration on the Semantic Data Web.
The scientific publications of the group founded in 2006 attracted already more than 2000 citations. The implemented tools and services developed by the group enjoy considerable popularity, the open-source semantic web framework OntoWiki for example is downloaded more than 500 times each month and applied in usage scenarios ranging from the authoring of bio-medical ontologies to knowledge management for the enterprise.

InfAI is leading several large-scale collaborative research projects on the national and EU levels such as the integrated project “LOD2 – Creating Knowledge out of Linked Data” (FP7-ICT), OntoWiki (FP7-SME), EFIE (German BmBF) and SCMS (Eureka). InfAI as a research partner can help to build the bridge between research and deployment in the use cases as done by Unister, BROX and Ontos.</dct:description>

  <ns2:Project rdf:about="GeoKnow"
    ns8:abbreviation="GeoKnow"
    rdfs:label="GeoKnow">
    <ns8:abstract xml:lang="en">The advent of the Data Web demonstrates how Web technologies can be employed to integrate dispersed, heterogeneous information. Most information - be it the extent of habitats of aquatic species, data warehouses of E-Commerce systems or offerings of the bakery shop next door - has a directly or indirectly associated spatial dimension. Integrating and efficiently using information with such a spatial dimension on the Web poses very particular challenges. 
First, we have to combine and reason about spatial and semantic features that use different vocabularies and representation techniques. Second, the wealth of pre-existing overlapping and complementary information sources in the spatial domain demands information management able to deal with billions of facts in a scalable manner. Third, only by dramatically lowering the entrance barriers extra value can be generated through the involvement of thousands of non-expert end users in authoring, curation and assessment. Within GeoKnow, we will tackle these challenges and spur the transition from islands of isolated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to a Web of interlinked Geographic Knowledge Systems (GKS).
We will validate our approach in two complementary application scenarios: (1) spatial-semantic collaboration in biological scientific communities involving citizen scientists and (2) spatial-semantic travel E-Commerce data management.
GeoKnow will substantially contribute to the evolution of the Web from a medium for information exchange to a medium for (spatial) knowledge integration, e.g. the number of spatial LOD sources will increase from 31to &gt;1,000. GeoKnow will help to realize network effects by increasing quality and coherence of the spatial Data Web, e.g. the data-linkage ratio will increase from 5% to 20%. For enterprises, the GeoKnow Generator will provide a cost-efficient way to integrate a variety of heterogeneous information sources within an Enterprise Data Intranet.</ns8:abstract>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">The goal of task 1.1 is to collect end user requirements from the application areas, and to specify the use cases for GeoKnow. The end users involved in the project (Unister, BROX) will heavily contribute to this task, as well as all other project partners. Further, current user communities (both end users and technology users) of Schnellecke, OpenStreetMap and geodata.gov.gr will be involved. Combined, these platforms provide access to millions of users with diverse (a) expertise (e.g. researchers, students. SMEs, citizens), (b) thematic areas (e.g. natural sciences, transport, statistics), and technology needs (e.g. data consumers, web services integration).
User requirements will be collected through a combination of appropriate instruments: (a) one-to one interviews with prominent users (10-15 users), (b) group meetings with expert users (10-15), (c) invitational online questionnaires for specific non-overlapping thematic areas and high technical expertise (30-60 users), (d) mass online questionnaires (100-200 users). The resulting requirements document for the GeoKnow Generator will be the basis for the subsequent RTD work. All tasks in WP2-WP4 that deal with requirement analysis and specification contribute to this joint activity. InfAI, OpenLink and Ontos will analyse and specify the technical requirements for metadata identification, access to spatial data, selection, construction of knowledge stores, and metadata transfer, that is, in tandem with the development and evaluation of the application-specific demonstrators developed in WP5-WP6, we will also define all necessary technical requirements related to the development under WP2-4.
The requirements will be monitored throughout the lifetime of the project, and in case some additional requirements have to be satisfied, an update of the deliverable D1.1.1 shall be prepared.</dct:description>

    <dct:description rdf:datatype="&sysont;Markdown">This task is devoted to specifying the GeoKnow architecture and the detailed design of the GeoKnow Generator. Scalability, extensibility and flexibility shall be achieved by employing Service Oriented Knowledge Utilities (SOKU) in order to develop next generation GKS. Components of the system will be building blocks developed in individual work packages WP2-4, such as the semantics based geo-spatial information management subsystem (WP2), spatial knowledge fusing and integration methods (WP3), the development of user interfaces for spatial-semantic browsing and authoring (WP4). The developed components will be integrated within this task. While the common technical requirements will be one major input for the system design, other major sources will be the developed use cases and end user requirements as well as interoperability standards.
The system design defines clear interfaces between the individual components. It will be based on existing standards and will provide a modular plug’n’serve structure and shall be able to accommodate REST components and JavaScript user interface widgets. The architecture will be centred around the OWL/RDF-statement paradigm, which enables interactions between components on different conceptual levels, such as triples, classes and instances, ontologies, logical axioms etc.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">During this task individual components developed in WP2-4 will be integrated into a ready to use GKS Generator and associated APIs in order to enable communities of practice to create domain specific GKSes with a minimum of effort. For example, chosing between map providers (e.g. OpenStreetMap, Google Maps) will require no coding, and there will be a widget library, based on the use-cases, with some widgets (e.g. for place searches, ratings, images and facts) being usable across multiple domains. A plug-in system will ensure that new styles and behaviour can be added in case none of the provided components turn out to be applicable.
Thus, this task consists of the following subtasks:
Integration of User Interface Components. The goal of this sub-task is to provide rich GUIs for social-aware GKS applications. 
Integration of GeoKnow Generator and API. The objective of this sub-task is to integrate the GeoKnow components developed in WP2-4 and the Web 2.0 toolkit into a ready to use GKS Generator with underlying service APIs. Within this task we will perform software integration activities together with WP2-4. 
Testing, documentation &amp; tutorials. This sub-task will take the end-user and technical feedbacks resulting from WP5-6 into account to improve the final GeoKnow Generator and provide documentation and tutorials. The documentation of the evaluation should provide both quantitative and qualitative results, through real-life trials of the proposed work. A number of alpha and beta testing results will be documented by this task, which will be conducted after the delivery of each module and provide quantitative results.</dct:description>

The GIS may be accessed via Virtuoso SQL federation, RDB-RDF mapping tools, such as Sparqlify, or web services or by simple file loading from a staging area. The goal is to make import of diversely standards compliant and diversely modelled geodata as nearly automatic as possible. Thereby possible workflows for dealing with updates on the source datasets will be analysed. For example, updates on small datasets may be published as files containing the complete new version of the dataset in monthly intervals. In contrast, providers of large datasets, such as OpenStreetMap, additionally publish files with minutely incremental changes. Alternatively, datasets may for instance already be published in SPARQL endpoints. This analysis will from a basis for the establishment of update processes that serve use cases of the project. In the process, performance of the Virtuoso GIS implementation will be tested and improvement targets identified.</dct:description>

    dct:identifier="T3.1">
    <dct:description xml:lang="en">One goal of this task is to develop algorithms and services to map spatial (datasets with geometric information) and non-spatial RDF data. For example, often datasets only contain implicit geographic references, such as city names. However, this information alone is not sufficient for unambiguously identifying geographic entities.A further goal is therefore to provide a tool assisted way of providing context information and parameterizing transformations for the generation of high quality RDF datasets. The following components will be developed:
a component to lift implicit geographical references in data sets. Given an RDF data set with implicit geographical references, the module will automatically detect potential types of geospatial information and the relations to existing vocabularies. For instance, a dataset containing address information could be automatically geocoded using a service such as Nominatim. The address information itself can be identified either by the used vocabulary or by crosschecking the used values against reference lists of e.g. country, city and street names. Additionally, this enables interlinking with spatial datasets, such as GeoNames, DBpedia or LinkedGeoData. The component will be manually evaluated (a) using information retrieval measures, such as precision and recall, and (b) by comparison with reference datasets. For large datasets, sampling methods will be applied. 
a component to configure transformation of data in conventional formats into RDF using existing vocabularies. Based on the detected implicit information,the user will be able to specify the type, format, granularity and amount of data being transformed. 
a distributed system for continuously processing a large amount of conventional data into an RDF representation based on the configuration. The challenge here is the expected amount of data to be processed. Since the original data sets remain unchanged and evolve over time it is required to be able to quickly re-process large amount of RDF data. This component will be evaluated for its performance, such as by measuring the process time for different datasets and dataset sizes.</dct:description>

While it helps new contributors to guide with suggestions for categories to be instantiated on a map more experienced users will want to add new categories at their wish. 
In this task we aim at consolidating the type of information entered in volunteered geographic knowledge bases not by restricting the set of categories but rather:
develop algorithms semantically consolidating the meaning of categories. We aim at developing algorithms automatically mapping newly added categories to existing categories. The user has then the choice to reuse an existing definition of a well described and frequently used category or begin to define a new category. Newly added categories will be grouped with other categories into higher types of categories.
investigate in a community driven consolidation process. Since we are aware that an algorithmic approach will not solve the problem entirely, the goal is to develop means to define aggregated categories and allow the community to agree on them.</dct:description>

In this task, we will develop metrics for volunteered geospatial information. The goal is to compare different maps and different regions of a map represented in the RDF data model. In particular we aim at developing metrics for the
coverage of a category in a region, e.g. the percentage of buildings contained in a part of the map,
precision of geometry and meta data, e.g. measuring the deviation of spatial objects from those in a reference dataset.
pertinence of geographic information, e.g. by comparing the number of occurrences of categories between regions of the same or different datasets. For example, this could be used for tracking the importance of nodes in a supply chain, by keeping track of the amount of goods that pass through them.

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">In this task we will develop a reusable components for visualizing and exploring spatial content. The component will consist of a library of different spatial-semantic visualization and exploration components:
A slippy map, which allows users to zoom-to and select a certain geographical area. The slippy map will be based on existing Web map implementations, such as for example OpenLayers1 from Open Source Geospatial Foundation. The implementation will be extended to allow an overlaying of the displayed raster maps with additional information represented in vector formats, such as various types of markers, polygons and curves. 
A facet filtering component, which displays (a hierarchy of) semantic facets detected in conjunction with the selected map area. Only facets, which have respective adhering objects in the selected area as well as the overall number of objects adhering to each facet in the selected area will be displayed. Depending on the facet type, different selection widgets will allow to specify eligible facet-constraints, e.g date and number ranges and enumeration of facet values.
A result view, which lists in addition to markers and regions on the map the retrieved objects adhering to the selected facets. For each individual object in the result set, its properties can be displayed in a configurable way. It will be possible to define templates for the visual presentation of certain spatial objects, e.g. train stations, cities, parks etc. Based on existing vocabularies such templates will display semantic information in a customizable and domain specific way. 
The components’ usability will be evaluated in the context of their integration into the portals of the project partners, as described in WP5 and WP6. For this reason, we do not plan to evaluate the usability of the widgets “on their own”, as this will be covered by the respective reports.

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">In this task, we will develop two components for the authoring and curation of spatial-semantic content. Firstly, we will specify a spatial-semantic widget interface, which will allow the creation of small reusable interface components for the creation of domain-specific user-interfaces. The widgets will be RDFa annotated HTML fragments together with JavaScript and CSS code. This will allow one to reuse them in various development environments, as for instance J2EE, LAMP, and Dot.Net. The widget interface definition will contain a number of event handlers, style classes, JavaScript functions, which concrete implementations must support. Widgets should be composeable out of existing smaller ones. For example, a widget for creating train stations, could be composed out of widgets for selecting a certain location and ones for representing object type, associating train lines etc. As part of this task we will develop a library of reusable widgets and common utilities.
In order to enable the curation of spatial-semantic knowledge, we will develop an interface allowing to curate (i.e. annotation or modification) single spatial objects or complete sets of spatial objects. The curation of sets of objects will start with a search and faceted-refinement. Subsequently, all retrieved spatial entities can be updated in a single step thus mimicking data cleansing tools from the database and ETL world.</dct:description>

The tool will give the user the ability to load the application with a custom dataset through one of the available SPARQL endpoints and retrieve the data they might be interested in on request, instead of (over)loading the mobile map with irrelevant information from the start. The user interface will consist of:

-  A slippy map component, used for quick and easy exploration of geographical areas, showing the user’s own position (GPS coordinates) and the surrounding area. The component will possibly be based on the extended OpenLayers map that is to be built in Task 4.1, but other mobile geospatial platforms will be considered as well.
- A semantic facet filtering component and a result view, similar to the desktop/webbased components described in Task 4.1.
- An authoring component, used for quick editing of existing information (e.g. fixing outdated information) and adding new information on the move. The tool will be available on at least one major mobile platform (Android, iOS, Windows Phone) in order to reach a larger target population and spark community engagement and contribution. As the resulting software solution will be used as a basis for Task 5.6, joint evaluation and testing activities for both components will be performed within Task 5.5 and reported on in Deliverable 5.5.

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">The first step in this task will be the identification and selection of relevant data partitions of existing real CRM systems and travel/tourism portals (e.g. ab-in-den-urlaub.de, travel24.com, fluege.de). Here, we will investigate internal data as well as its interlinkability with other open data sets as geospatial and spatial social network data. We will develop retrieval methods and tools and aggregate this data. Additionally, we will execute preparations and needed transformations on that data to ensure ease of integration with the GKS and efficient processing of the data. A part of this will be the transformation into an RDF representation. In Task 6.1 a proprietary CRM, developed in-house at Unister, is used. Because Unister has to deal with many different and changing vendors of travel/tourism services and products, this special CRM takes into account the many different CRM data structures provided by these vendors. It is more appropriate to identify it as system of CRMs.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">The first focus of WP7 is the dissemination of the project results supported by community building and cross-fertilisation activities.
Both the industrial and the academic partners will play active roles in dissemination. For the use case partners, the case studies will form a key part of the dissemination activity. For the academic partners, consultancy to business and contractual research and development will be a significant part of dissemination, besides the normal channels of publications, conference papers, workshop organisation, and educational courses at university sites.
The dissemination programme foresees a multi-channel dissemination approach. First, the project outcomes will be disseminated by use of publicly available channels – such as workshop, conference, magazine, and journal publications. These will be aimed at sharing the results of the project with the scientific community, particularly the European, but also the international scientific community, to encourage their incorporation into the work of other scientists and technologists. Complementing this, there will be a programme of papers and articles in IT, Web Technologies and general business publications, and presentations at geo data, library, IT and business expos and conferences (e.g. LinkedDataPlanet, KM Europe, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), Digital Curation Conference, CeBIT or Systems for telecommunication and IT) particularly targeted at the European Union and associated countries. We envisage that the innovative technology required for building spatial Linked Data applications, and the resulting open GeoKnow Generator, will be of great interest to both SMEs and large businesses alike.
We will put a special focus on demonstration activities in different forms of the possibilities that the newly developed technologies will offer. Target audience will be relevant industry and research actors whose main focus is the development of data and knowledge management systems, new scalable collaboration paradigms and their combination with information retrieval. The participation of globally acting partners (Ontos, OpenLink, BROX) will provide an additional, global dimension to our dissemination programme, in particular with Unister and Openlink as a globally acting E-Commerce and software vendor with offices in the US, and major European countries. Taking advantage of its worldwide unique information infrastructure, with products for enterprise information management, Unister can provide current research and technological solutions developed by the GeoKnow partners an ideal environment for demonstrating their real added value. The GeoKnow consortium will organize two end-user and industry days, one for each of the two case study applications corporate spatial business intelligence and e-science.
The project will set up and maintain an external Web site, which will function as a project dissemination tool, as a training portal and as a server demonstrating some of the project results. The Web site will itself be based on a Semantic Wiki system, so that project participants and interested users can register and be notified when new deliverables or software become available. Within the limitations imposed by appropriate protection of intellectual property, all major scientific results of this project will be made available to the research community, whilst the GeoKnow and components will be published as open source to facilitate take-up. Outcomes will be made available in a non-proprietary format. All open source components published will be extensively documented by means of textual documents and screencasts of professional quality illustrating how to download, install and operate the components in question. Documentation manuals and screencasts will be specifically identified as project deliverables and prominently published on the project&apos;s web site. The project will exploit modern, social-networking dissemination channels such as Weblogs, Newsfeeds (RSS), organize GeoKnow groups in social networks such as LinkedIn, XING, Facebook, Twine. The project will register its web site under the .eu domain for at least 2 years after the natural contractual end of the project and commit to keeping the web site alive for that period of time. It will link to other relevant EC and EC sponsored sites. 
The project will also deliver one or more web-based showcases and grant the EC the right to use the showcase(s) for its own dissemination and awareness activities. After the completion of the project. The Showcase(s) will feature a meaningful subset (software, data, etc.) of the functionality characterising the project demonstrator(s) arrived at, along with relevant copyright notices and contact information, and suitable installation aids and run-time interfaces.
GeoKnow will create a Researcher Early Access Group that will be open to participation to scientists working in related fields. Members of this group will get early access to project infrastructure and will be invited to experiment with GeoKnow components. This will both verify the generality of the plug-in interfaces and encourage take-up of the project results. The scientific communities that will be targeted by our inter-disciplinary community building efforts are very diverse and hitherto largely independent of each other: Geodata Management, Semantic Web and knowledge technologies, machine learning, e-science, and Big Data Management. 
In the first month of the project, the GeoKnow consortium will create a fact sheet suitable for Web publishing. The Fact Sheet will outline the project&apos;s rationale and objectives, specify its technical baseline and intended target groups and application domains, and detail intermediate and final outputs. The facts-sheet will be maintained and updated until the end of the project; this will be documented in the regular dissemination reports. It will be published on the website and related EC sponsored websites controlled by the consortium. Related to the fact sheet, the consortium will issue press releases within one month of the start of the project (prepared by InfAI and Ontos, translation and dissemination by all partners). The press releases will target the local or national press of all partners. The press release will describe the goals of the project in simple, jargon free language and whenever possible highlight the benefits to the region/country and the importance of the local partner being part of a EU consortium. A PDF version of the collection of such press releases will be listed as part of Deliverable D7.1.1. 
If suitable, the consortium may commit to radio and TV appearances. If this is feasible audio/video clips will also be submitted as additional deliverables.
Additionally, we plan to promote cross-fertilisation through inter-disciplinary workshops, organized alongside major conferences in the respective research fields. The GeoKnow partners representing each of these diverse research areas will be responsible to promote the project results within the respective communities. The project partners undertake – when invited – to contribute to and participate in focused concertation actions, themed seminars or special interest groups.</dct:description>

    <dct:description xml:lang="en">The two case studies and the industrial and end-user community partners will drive the exploitation. Their task is to extend the research activities by promoting and supporting the exploitation of the results along with take-up activities related to the perspective applications. The majority of the project results will be made available as open source and the open source exploitation strategy will describe how to leverage the potential of such an open source initiative.
The pillars of GeoKnow exploitation strategy are: tracking important technical and commercial developments in geo data management, semantic web, Web 2.0 as well as geospatial e-science and enterprise applications; analyzing the market sector(s) where the results can be applied and possibly licensed commercially; identifying the results of GeoKnow that are exploitable: particularly the GeoKnow Generator, some of the components and the innovative applications developed within the use cases; and identifying the appropriate distribution channels (including open source community) to exploit the different results of the project.
The major outcome of this work package will be the GeoKnow Exploitation Plan, which will include a list of opportunities that arise from GeoKnow scientific and technical achievements and a detailed analysis of benefit and impact for the GeoKnow consortium as a whole as well as for the results of individual participants. The prestige of both the industrial partners and the use case partners makes the GeoKnow Consortium an international partnership.</dct:description>

In a GKS users are not constraint by a rigid data model, but can use any representation of information adhering to the RDF data model. This can include information represented according to heterogeneous, interconnected vocabularies defined and published on the Data Web, as well as newly defined attributes and classification structures. Hence, the GKS user interface components should support the reuse of existing vocabularies and ontologies as well as the Ad hoc definition of new ones and their refinement and evolution over time. Different information structures should be seamlessly combinable in a single visualisation or authoring environment, even if the information to be visualized or authored is obtained or stored in various GKS and other Linked Data sources. The objectives of the WP4 are to develop (1) new exploration, (2) visualisation and (3) authoring &amp; curation interfaces for GKS, which support a wide range of devices (from mobile phones to desktop PCs), which integrate heterogeneous information from various sources and support the evolution of both instance data as well as information structures over time. In order to achieve these objectives we will explore new exploration and visualisation paradigms. For example, we will extend facetted browsing techniques such that the facetted browsing can be combined with the spatial dimension.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The first focus of WP7 is the dissemination of the project results supported by community building and cross-fertilisation activities.
Both the industrial and the academic partners will play active roles in dissemination. For the use case partners, the case studies will form a key part of the dissemination activity. For the academic partners, consultancy to business and contractual research and development will be a significant part of dissemination, besides the normal channels of publications, conference papers, workshop organisation, and educational courses at university sites.
The dissemination programme foresees a multi-channel dissemination approach. First, the project outcomes will be disseminated by use of publicly available channels â€“ such as workshop, conference, magazine, and journal publications. These will be aimed at sharing the results of the project with the scientific community, particularly the European, but also the international scientific community, to encourage their incorporation into the work of other scientists and technologists. Complementing this, there will be a programme of papers and articles in IT, Web Technologies and general business publications, and presentations at geo data, library, IT and business expos and conferences (e.g. LinkedDataPlanet, KM Europe, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI), Digital Curation Conference, CeBIT or Systems for telecommunication and IT) particularly targeted at the European Union and associated countries. We envisage that the innovative technology required for building spatial Linked Data applications, and the resulting open GeoKnow Generator, will be of great interest to both SMEs and large businesses alike.
We will put a special focus on demonstration activities in different forms of the possibilities that the newly developed technologies will offer. Target audience will be relevant industry and research actors whose main focus is the development of data and knowledge management systems, new scalable collaboration paradigms and their combination with information retrieval. The participation of globally acting partners (Ontos, OpenLink, BROX) will provide an additional, global dimension to our dissemination programme, in particular with Unister and Openlink as a globally acting E-Commerce and software vendor with offices in the US, and major European countries. Taking advantage of its worldwide unique information infrastructure, with products for enterprise information management, Unister can provide current research and technological solutions developed by the GeoKnow partners an ideal environment for demonstrating their real added value. The GeoKnow consortium will organize two end-user and industry days, one for each of the two case study applications corporate spatial business intelligence and e-science.
The project will set up and maintain an external Web site, which will function as a project dissemination tool, as a training portal and as a server demonstrating some of the project results. The Web site will itself be based on a Semantic Wiki system, so that project participants and interested users can register and be notified when new deliverables or software become available. Within the limitations imposed by appropriate protection of intellectual property, all major scientific results of this project will be made available to the research community, whilst the GeoKnow and components will be published as open source to facilitate take-up. Outcomes will be made available in a non-proprietary format. All open source components published will be extensively documented by means of textual documents and screencasts of professional quality illustrating how to download, install and operate the components in question. Documentation manuals and screencasts will be specifically identified as project deliverables and prominently published on the project&apos;s web site. The project will exploit modern, social-networking dissemination channels such as Weblogs, Newsfeeds (RSS), organize GeoKnow groups in social networks such as LinkedIn, XING, Facebook, Twine. The project will register its web site under the .eu domain for at least 2 years after the natural contractual end of the project and commit to keeping the web site alive for that period of time. It will link to other relevant EC and EC sponsored sites. 
The project will also deliver one or more web-based showcases and grant the EC the right to use the showcase(s) for its own dissemination and awareness activities. After the completion of the project. The Showcase(s) will feature a meaningful subset (software, data, etc.) of the functionality characterising the project demonstrator(s) arrived at, along with relevant copyright notices and contact information, and suitable installation aids and run-time interfaces.
GeoKnow will create a Researcher Early Access Group that will be open to participation to scientists working in related fields. Members of this group will get early access to project infrastructure and will be invited to experiment with GeoKnow components. This will both verify the generality of the plug-in interfaces and encourage take-up of the project results. The scientific communities that will be targeted by our inter-disciplinary community building efforts are very diverse and hitherto largely independent of each other: Geodata Management, Semantic Web and knowledge technologies, machine learning, e-science, and Big Data Management. 
In the first month of the project, the GeoKnow consortium will create a fact sheet suitable for Web publishing. The Fact Sheet will outline the project&apos;s rationale and objectives, specify its technical baseline and intended target groups and application domains, and detail intermediate and final outputs. The facts-sheet will be maintained and updated until the end of the project; this will be documented in the regular dissemination reports. It will be published on the website and related EC sponsored websites controlled by the consortium. Related to the fact sheet, the consortium will issue press releases within one month of the start of the project (prepared by InfAI and Ontos, translation and dissemination by all partners). The press releases will target the local or national press of all partners. The press release will describe the goals of the project in simple, jargon free language and whenever possible highlight the benefits to the region/country and the importance of the local partner being part of a EU consortium. A PDF version of the collection of such press releases will be listed as part of Deliverable D7.1.1. 
If suitable, the consortium may commit to radio and TV appearances. If this is feasible audio/video clips will also be submitted as additional deliverables.
Additionally, we plan to promote cross-fertilisation through inter-disciplinary workshops, organized alongside major conferences in the respective research fields. The GeoKnow partners representing each of these diverse research areas will be responsible to promote the project results within the respective communities. The project partners undertake â€“ when invited â€“ to contribute to and participate in focused concertation actions, themed seminars or special interest groups.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">GeoKnow will actively participate in appropriate standards bodies, specifically the W3C and/or DC. Such participation is twofold; on the one hand to ensure that established and emerging standards are taken into account appropriately in the GeoKnow project and, on the other hand, to seek to influence standardisation bodies. Concrete standardisation activities pursued in the context of GeoKnow are listed in section B1.9.4. The consortium represented by its W3C members (OpenLink and Ontos) will together with other actors establish a W3C Spatial Linked Data interest group in order to found a nucleolus for the growing user community of Spatial Data Web technologies.</rdfs:comment>
