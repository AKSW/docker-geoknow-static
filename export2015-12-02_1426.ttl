ns4:t5-5 dct:description "In this task, the GeoKnow demonstrator application will be tested wrt. performance, usability and robustness. The testing methodology will be based on (1) the definition of a test-bed scenario and test-protocol at Schnellecke, (2) the deployment of the GeoKnow demonstrator application for this test-bed, (3) the training of respective operational personnel, (4) live test where operational personnel will spend at least 20 hours testing the system according to a the-specified test-protocol, (5) assessment of the test results and derivation of application and deployment guidelines. The operational personnel will be people involved in managing and executing logistics services in the supply chain from Schnellecke and cooperation partners. This will include people dealing with operational procedures (e.g. operating RFID readers) directly in the supply chain, supervisors and management personnel aiming to gain oversight and strategic views on the supply chain. We will also assess in this task to what extent additional information from the LOD cloud is beneficial and for which particular tasks. Currently, we do not foresee logistics partners' data to be published openly on the Web. Particular attention during the test and evaluation will be paid to involving several stakeholders to for obtaining a unified view on the supply chain. The test-bed and test-data as well as contacts to additional stakeholders and organizations required for this task will be provided by Schnellecke (cf. Letter of Support) free of charge to the project."@en ;
